# SLR-201: Advanced Programming and Project Management (Java-based)
Repository for my work over the 2nd year course SLR-201 at Télécom Paris 

Objective:  This course aims to introduce the basic notions necessary for the understanding and development of distributed applications (focused on Java). It also aims to introduce the concept of middleware and to provide two concrete examples of different middleware types: based on remote method invocations and message-oriented communication models.

Syllabus:  This course includes the following subjects:
- Java threads, synchronisation, object serialisation, input/output and sockets;
- Introduction to middleware, Remote Method Invocation (RMI) and Java Message Service (JMS).
- Practical works will be based on the topics above; Apache ANT will be used to help compile and execute implemented applications.
